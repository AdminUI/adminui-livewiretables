# Laravel 7 Livewire Tables

We use laravel-eloquent-joins by Fico99 to provide the easy
ability to sort and search by data fields

Use php artisan make:alwtable <name>

If you wish to format some date on the returned collection
use either a model mutator

https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent-mutators

or use a collection map function

https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent-collections

Enjoy!
